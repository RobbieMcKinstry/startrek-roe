    <ol>
      <h2>General</h2>
      <li>If a ship or station is "protected", then attacking it is an act of war, except as noted under <i>Retaliation</i>, and therefore attacking a protected target is a violation of these rules. 
      <h2>Survey Ships and Miners</h2>
      <li>Survey ships are protected while UPC, unless they have participated in PvP combat or on a zero node, as indicated below.</li>
      <li>Survey ships that are OPC are not protected.</li>
      <li>Survey ships that are on a zero node are protected until a warning message has been sent to the ship ower. At which point, the ship is no longer protected.</li>
      <li>Survey ships that have recently participated in PvP combat are not protected. Examples of such unprotected combat include station defense, station raids. Clearing a zeroed mining node does not count as PvP combat for the purposes of this rule.</li>
      <h2>Kill On Sight</h2>
      <li>If your alliance has determined a player or enemy alliance to be "Kill on Sight" (KOS), they are not protected under any circumstances.</li>
      <li>Only alliance admirals can deem a player to be Kill on Sight.</li>
      <h2>Retaliation</h2>
      <li>If an aggressor attacks a protected target in violation of these rules, the victim may retaliate against the aggressor exactly once within 24 hours of the initial attack, despite any protected the aggressor may have.</li>
      <h2>Warships and Stations</h2>
      <li>Warships do not have protected status, except as noted under <i>Events</i> and <i>Alliances</i></li>
      <li>Stations do not have protected status, except as noted under <i>Events</i> and <i>Alliances</i></li>
      <h2>Events</h2>
      <li>During Scopely-official in-game events, systems in which events are occurring provide protected status to all UPC ships.</li>
      <li>Additionally, OPC ships are not protected, and may be attacked <i>only after</i> a warning is sent to the ower of the OPC ship.</li>
      <li>Swarm space (i.e. systems which only contain swarm hostiles) are considered Event space for the purposes of these rules.</li>
